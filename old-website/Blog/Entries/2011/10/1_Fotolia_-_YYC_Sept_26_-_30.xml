    <richText>&lt;b&gt;So my first day of Project ONE12, was the day after I celebrated my 24th birthday. Pretty crazy hey?! I think this journey is a great way to celebrate a new year :) &#xD;&#xD;My first week of interning brought me to Fotolia, a stock photography company in downtown Calgary that has some inspirational and unique individuals running the business. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;-- this is me, my first day. :) I had the weirdest rush of emotions that morning, I was super nervous... because I didn&#x2019;t really know what I was getting myself into, but I was also super stoked because I was anxious to start working and being busy again! &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
