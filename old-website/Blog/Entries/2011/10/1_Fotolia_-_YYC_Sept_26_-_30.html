                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">My first week of interning brought me to Fotolia, a stock photography company in downtown Calgary that has some inspirational and unique individuals running the business. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">&lt;-- this is me, my first day. :) I had the weirdest rush of emotions that morning, I was super nervous... because I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into, but I was also super stoked because I was anxious to start working and being busy again! </p>

                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">But looking back over the last 2 months of planning this endeavour, I can’t BELIEVE how much I have already learned from not just the planning and contacting people, but the amount of knowledge there was to be gained in a week of working. I mean, this is the first time in 10 years I have worked in an office outside of the mortgage company, first time working downtown, and first time have ever taken the train to work!   <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Taking the train was interesting....  not only did I have to wake up super early, it is so unpredictable.  It drove me bonkers that I would leave the same time every morning - an hour a head of time... and some days I would show up 20 min early, others I would show up right on time.   I really dislike not having control of my time. I have “mad respect” now for all my friends who rode the bus/train daily through out jr. high and high school.  I can now see how frustrating it can be..  But it is something I had to adjust to from working downtown.  I now realize I have been very spoiled to have been able to drive my car to work everyday.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I had quite the intense week - emotional ups and downs.  I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well, mainly because I want to do well... but I guess I let it get to my head sometimes and stress out.  I am making the video blog for it tonight (gosh, things are so busy here!!) but I wanted to share with you a bit of insight.  I had such excitement and confidence for my first day, but I got really overwhelmed with information.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The experience is great, I worked on a social media plan with Fotolia and got to learn quite a bit about their company.  Its a small office with about 8 people and a very self directed work atmosphere.  I dig that, I like being given a task and allowed to use creativity and self-directed learning to complete the task.  I know that is not for everyone, but with homeschooling... that is what I do! I could bounce ideas off my co-workers, and get some insight from different people/views.  It really allowed a unique opportunity for me to figure out how great it is to be creative!! The days went by so quickly because I was teaching myself new things and if I had questions.. I had to find the answers.  It was challenging yet, rewarding to finish the day and feel like - wow I just learned something new!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The atmosphere was much more relaxed than what I was used to. At my last company, I was at my desk all day and couldn’t go anywhere without informing where I was going. Which is fair - you need to make sure people know where you are if your work is unattended.  But  at Fotolia, Its a jean and t-shirt (super casual) type of place.  I often received comments on my “Trendy European Scarves” and jackets.  :) It was a fun place to work though, the office has an open concept.... no cubicles, or separate offices.. its all in one big room and the desks are all connected.  So even if i wasn’t working on something, and one of my coworkers needed help... I had a basic idea of what he/she was talking about because I either heard them chat about it on the phone, or discuss it with others in the office.  I felt it made me more efficient and able to contribute to other people’s work on top of what I was instructed to do. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The first day was a lot of information... learning about the company, the work they wanted me to accomplish, and general discussion.  I was feeling good, I had a good grasp on what I thought had to happen.  Then on day 2, I collected all the information and started doing framework for the social media plan.   Then... day 3 rolls around and it was terrible. I had hit a wall (I posted a status on facebook... i wasn’t going to... but the emotional part of  this journey was what I wanted to share... its part of the process of learning... so thank you to all you wonderful people who supported me :) I appreciate you!!) but I realized I hadn’t even gotten half way through the media plan, and I only had 2 days left to finish.  I started doubting myself thinking..... “Gosh, you dumb girl.. what can you really accomplish in 5 days... you are not as great as you want to be.. you should give up, this was a stupid idea.. get a job and stop trying to be different”.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">.. ya. tough day.  But I told myself to keep asking questions and working hard.  I showed the plan to my boss the 4th day and to my surprise, he was really happy with the progress, and gave me a few critiques to make it better.  At that point,  I realized that the hardest person I was trying to impress was myself...  after I clued in to that, my attitude changed, and I just kept up the pace to what I was trying to accomplish.  Self-challenge is a good thing.. it is what motivates you to grow and be better, but it can also be a “negative nancy” on occasion... and I really had to learn that the negativity shouldn’t bring me down, it should challenge me to work harder. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">When I was younger, I told my closest friend that I had gotten in to college at Mount Royal.. it was the scariest and most exciting letter I had ever received, and I was really terrified to go to school (it was my first time ever going!!).  After telling that friend how scared I was...she looked at me and said “Maeghan, you are far too stupid to go to school, you will never be able to graduate”.  Let me tell you... those words haunted me through out my first two YEARS of school and were the leading reason I played with the decision to drop out.  But when I was finally able to just accept them as just words and not walls, I was able to do some pretty special things at my school.  :) And let me tell you...  walking across the stage at convocation, it was probably one of the most special feelings I have ever had.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So my week at Fotolia was done, I finished the report and got to learn some pretty cool things.  I packed my bags on Sunday and am in LA for the Adobe MAX conference learning just a ton more!!! <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">There is more to come... so stay tuned and stay awesome. :) <br /></p>
