    <richText>Oh hey!&#xD;&#xD;I guess this is the end to a new beginning for me.  Getting ready for project ONE12, helping my sister and my friends get ready for school, and cleaning up my desk as I approach my last week of work... for a company that I have been employed at for the last 10 years of my life.  &#xD;&#xD;It has been a tough week!  I cry randomly.... and smack my forehead to stop... but its only because I am leaving everything that I am so comfortable with, and so happy with, to do something that is so different.. it kind of scares me.  &#xD;&#xD;I am sure you are thinking... why are you doing it then!?  Well, you never grow and become better when you are comfortable.  &#xD;&#xD;I have been so blessed with the support of my friends, MRU faculty, and family on this this crazy idea, but I know it&#x2019;s the first step I must take to get my &#x201C;dream job&#x201D; which I am beyond stoked to find.  I also believe that the wisdom and learning I gain from this project will not only make a significant difference in my life, but allow me to share the experience in the hopes of inspiring others.  And the thought of that simply excites me.   &#xD;&#xD;Something I always say to new students is.... &#x201C;an education is just an education.. unless you use it&#x201D;, and that is exactly what I am doing.  I am taking 5 years of creative thinking, organization, planning, project management, initiative, and strategy to determine where I want to be by the time this project is up. I don&#x2019;t just want to take any job, I want to work in a company that interests me, so I can say I love it and will work tireless because I simply enjoy what I am doing.. and that is the goal and where I want to be for the new year!&#xD;&#xD;&#x201C;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams&#x201D; - Eleanor Roosvelt  &#xD;&#xD;I believe with hard work and high spirits, dreams find ways to come true. &#xD;&#xD;:) &#xD;&#xD;Just Maeghan. &#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD; &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
