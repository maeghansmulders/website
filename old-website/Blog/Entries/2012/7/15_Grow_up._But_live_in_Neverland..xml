    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I remember being 15 years old telling my friends that by the time I turned 25, I would be living in California, on a beach, with a dog, a porsche and be married to Justin Timberlake with out a doubt in my mind.  It seemed possible - I mean, I had 10 years to make it happen!!!  So you can imagine my massive disappointment and quarter life crisis that occurred when I turned 21 and realized that the life I had pictured wasn&#x2019;t going to happen &lt;/b&gt;(The closest I have been to Justin Timberlake was in concert and although he looked directly at me... I couldn&#x2019;t tell if the connection was love at first sight or the feeling of nausea from the flashing lights&lt;b&gt;). &#xD;&#xD;I am still marginally depressed that I am not married to Mr. JT on the year of my 25th bday... but at the same time, I don&#x2019;t share the same undying love for him as I did when I was fifteen &lt;/b&gt;(which might change if he makes a new album someday soon..... hint hint Justin... ;D ) &#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;The reality is, we change.  It is totally normal not to love the same things you did as a kid.  My parents call this..... &#x201C;growing up&#x201D;. &#xD;&#xD;What I find interesting with growing up is that the more we age, the less we act like kids. I know you may be thinking... well yes, its not appropriate to behave like a child when you have responsibility or know better.&#xD;&#xD;Sure, that is what our mature self is telling us.. but I see three problems with it:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;	1)	 We lose excitement for life &#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;My neighbours from Calgary came with their two kids to Montreal this week and I volunteered to babysit them for a few hours. When I got to their hotel, I asked the kids if they wanted to go to a water fountain....  Well.. between the two of them, I got a 20 min rant response about their swim suits, love for bringing their toys - more specifically their trains into the water and how much they loved water fountains. &#xD;&#xD;I just sat back and laughed - Ryan (&lt;/b&gt;the younger one.&lt;b&gt;.) was so excited about going that he spoke too quickly and could only announce every second or third word that came out of his mouth and left the rest to mumbling.&#xD;&#xD;As an adult... have you ever had a moment like that? SO excited to share the world as you see with others?  &#xD;&#xD;In the last few months, I have been meeting and chatting with a lot of different people - small talk and business related.  It blows my mind how almost all conversations I have are routine.... no matter the setting.  &#x201C;How is work?&#x201D; &#x201C;What do you do?&#x201D; &#x201C;How is the family?&#x201D; &#x201C;How was the weekend?&#x201D;  etc...  with maybe one or two other personal questions tossed in there. &#xD;&#xD;I don&#x2019;t know about you.. but discussions like this can get boring!  Now, I don&#x2019;t expect to have a conversation about water fountains with everyone.... but after spending the evening with Ryan &amp; Oliver.. I wondered what happened to our courage and excitement to share stories of things that we enjoy, or the conversation of random details/events that happened through out the day. You know, the little things in life, not necessarily the routine things... &#xD;&#xD;Last week I had an epic fail trying to wash my car &lt;/b&gt;(it involves me leaving my windows open and being just soaked by the machine and the old lady behind me waiting 20 min to wash her car because I had no idea how to make the machine work..&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;)&lt;b&gt;  Although no one has specifically asked me &#x201C;Hey Maeghan, did you wash your car this week?&#x201D;, I am asked quite often about how I am liking Montreal, or how my weekends are.  So I have taken it upon my own accord to steer the conversation and share the world as I see it.  Something I have notice about doing this is that it brings a smile to the listeners face, a sense of trust and perspective that wasn&#x2019;t there before and the listener remembers what we talked about and often shares the story with others.  Now I see how beneficial it is to be thrilled about what you love, or the things you do. It has impact and substance that stands out in a crowd and makes you, you. &#xD;&#xD;Don&#x2019;t loose your excitement - life is collection of moments, not things. It may seem irrelevant or &#x201C;childish&#x201D; to notice and appreciate random details.. but it is a perspective in your life that is unique to you.  Share it with others and you will be surprised at impression it leaves. &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;2) We lose our ability to grow and be better&#xD;&lt;b&gt;My second week in Montreal was a tough one.  I have been living on the road for the greater portion of 2 years, but coming to Montreal is my first time moving out of my home in Calgary and officially living on my own.  If you don&#x2019;t know this about me, I am ridiculous and put a lot of pressure on myself and have an even higher expectation to do good things (&lt;/b&gt;work or personally related&lt;b&gt;).  But in my 2nd week here, I was still learning and gathering information about my job (&lt;/b&gt;I expected to be making millions of dollars in just 8 days... so I was anxious to why it was taking me so long.. haha ridiculous expectations point and example&lt;b&gt;), I didn&#x2019;t have any friends or family here so my evenings and weekends were spent alone in my apartment or walking around the streets and finally, I had no committed responsibility &lt;/b&gt;(Back in Calgary, I was volunteering, meeting people, working and doing school so my days were packed full... this is the first time in 4 years that I had absolutely nothing to do).  &lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#x2028;The tipping point of this lesson was on my 2nd Sunday here, I was walking in Montreal when a homeless man chased and pushed me on the street.  It scared the living daylights out of me and no one around did anything to help.... I was completely alone with a crowd watching. The thought terrified me to the effect that thunderstorms or monsters scare children - I didn&#x2019;t know how I was going to move on without my family around and needed them to tell me everything was going to be alright.   I got back to my apartment crying and couldn&#x2019;t sleep that night. Monday came and I asked my boss that If I died, would anyone notice or come to find me? I don&#x2019;t think this is a question many people ask themselves..&#xD; &#xD;I was so scared, lost and overwhelmed with my responsibility to be an adult and grow up.. that I was on the edge of quitting my new job, packing my bags and heading home to Calgary.  &#xD;&#xD;After work that day, I called my mentor and had an emotional break down... I hadn&#x2019;t felt that terrible about anything in a really long time.  He calmed me down and told me that these feelings and thoughts were natural... so I took his words to digest and went for a walk to clear my mind.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;I was thinking for hours on how I reacted and as time went by, started to think about ways I could prevent the fear from happening again.  I didn&#x2019;t have the security blanket of my family... but I made it a priority to talk with people, text all the time, hang out and make new friends.  I even made a point to take some time off and volunteer to meet local people which helped wonders. &#xD;&#xD;At first, I was embarrassed by this.  An adult crying like a baby because she was scared and missed home. But the more I talked to people trying to solve my problem.. the more I realized that very few actually ask for help when they need a hand.. and an even smaller amount work towards anything that has risk or hardship associated with it.  &#xD;&#xD;Now, I would never wish hardship, fear or challenges to anyone... but this is a lesson that really surprised me. &#xD;&#xD;We have this idea that as adults.. we should have our shit together and not go out looking for trouble.  But in retrospect of my time here, I&#x2019;ve grown so much by facing these struggles on my own... even though I already considered myself an adult... i guess there is always more room to grow. &#xD;&#xD;As a kid we have the excuse to crawl in to mom and dads bed and hide under the covers till the moment passes.. but as an adult we shouldn&#x2019;t be ashamed of those feelings, we just have to deal with it differently.  I know I have the ability to be courageous, find solutions, talk to people and turn that fear into an opportunity to grow and be better. That is a pretty big lesson to learn.&#xD;&#xD;Don&#x2019;t be afraid of your childish emotions... love, fear, excitement etc.. they can be a bit over dramatic.. but paired with the wisdom of an adult we can grow from them and learn to be better.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;	1)	We stop dreaming..&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;I love watching kids play make-believe, imagine they are in some magical place, play games with their imaginary friends or boldly state that they are going to grow up and be an astronaut, rock star, fireman or Justin Timberlake&#x2019;s wife.. &#xD;&#xD;I said it before..... dreams/priorities changes as we grow old but what&#x2019;s sad is that with age dreams stop to flow as freely.&#xD;&#xD;We focus our lives around the responsibility we have oppose to finding a balance and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;making the space&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; to dream and pursue crazy things.&#xD;&#xD;Its not as easy to chase what we desire when responsibility, relationships and family fill our thoughts, but there is something about actively working towards our goals that satisfies us in life - no matter our age. &#xD;&#xD;Work hard to find balance and make time to dream.  I believe its so important!!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Peter Pan is my favourite movie.. I always thought that growing up was a trap and that I would stop loving life the day I got old &lt;/b&gt;(Old used to be the age of 30....)&lt;b&gt;  But today... I see it differently.&#xD;&#xD;Growing up gives me the tools to pursue the things I want to achieve in life. I am brave, more knowledgable, able to solve my own problems and fund the things I want to. &#xD;&#xD;But living in Neverland opens my mind to a greater world of possibility.  I don&#x2019;t think my ideas are stupid, my moments in life are silly or my excitement to try new things is irrelevant. Being child at heart and adult in mind gives me the chance to create a new world and flourish in it. &#xD;&#x2028;These thoughts have helped me in Montreal.  Not only in meeting people, but in having impact and being ok with the fact that it can be scary on your own.  I hope you realize that age is just a number.. but youth lives in us forever. &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;Some people are old at 18 and some are young at 90... time is a concept that humans created. &lt;b&gt; &#x2028;  - Yuko Ono&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Much&lt;3 &#x2028;Just Maeghan &#xD;&#xD;&#xD; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I dedicate this post to Chris Arsenault &amp; Zoe Desroches --the two Montreal'ers who got me through my 2nd week here. :) I appreciate you. &#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Here are pictures from my new adventure in Montreal:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151038027951385.457078.504426384&amp;type=1"&gt;new life. the way i see it. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
