			<h4>Description:</h4>
				<p>True Key by Intel Security is an award-winning mobile and desktop app to remove the hassle of passwords. â€¨â€¨It lets you log into the app using things unique to you like your face or fingerprint, so you can log in to the rest of the web password-free.</p> 

				<p>After PasswordBox was acquired in 2015, True Key was a new joint product we built together with Intel. My team grew along with some new responsibilies as the public face and creative soul of the True Key. ðŸ¤—</p>
