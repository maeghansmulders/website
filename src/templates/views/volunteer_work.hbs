			<h4>Description:</h4>
				<p>My parents incorporated giving back into my studies while homeschooling growing up and today I value being able to giveback where I can.</p> 

				<p>Iâ€™ve locally lead meetup groups for women in tech, had the opportunity to volunteer abroad as well as, create programs for military families in Canada to start businesses while their loved ones were serving in the war. </p>
