      <h2>Hi there,</h2>
      <p>I’m a product marketer / creative soul that was born in Calgary and lives between Montreal, Canada and San Francisco, California.</p>
      <p>I solve problems in unconventional ways: I created ProjectONE12, an initiative to intern at 10 different companies in 112 days across North America. My goal was to experience then define a career path that was right for me.</p>
      <p>I love technology like PasswordBox: a startup I joined as Director of Product Marketing.  We launched the app from private beta and engaged with millions of users around the world.</p>
      <p>I’m grateful for the opportunities with Intel: after PasswordBox was acquired I became an evangelist and strategic awareness specialist. I worked with household names in developing creative campaigns, leading strategic partnership announcements, global training & education. I had the chance to be the face of True Key by Intel Security.</p>

  <h2>Work & Projects</h2>
  <p>I'm on a mission to do big things with people I admire, and strongly believe it starts with finding passion and purpose. <br>Here's a peek of some work that includes collaborations with folks from the White House, Girls Learning Code, Microsoft and more.</p>
