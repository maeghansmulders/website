			<h4>Description:</h4>
				<p>In 2017 I had the opportunity to take an extended coffee break and embark on a year long  adventure around the world.</p> 

				<p>I discovered so much during this time and created A Little Detour with my partner so that we could reflect on our travels for keepsake and reassure our moms while we were away, that we are doing okay. </p>
